    React custom hook

    A custom Hook is a special function.
    ...
    All Hooks follow some restrictions:
    A Hook name must start with “use.”
    A Hook must be called from a function component or from another Hook.
    Only call Hooks at the top level. Do not call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
